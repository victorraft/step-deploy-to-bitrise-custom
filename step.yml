        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory then every file
        in the directory will be deployed - but only the
        files in the specified directory, sub-directories
        won't be uploaded. For uploading the directory's content
        recursively you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path then only the specified
        file will be deployed.

        If you want to notify everyone in your team just specify `everyone`.

        If you don't want to notify anyone set this to `none`.

        with others who are not registered on Bitrise.

        **If you disable this option the Notify Emails option will
        be ignored and the Notify Groups will receive the build's
        URL instead of the public page's URL!**
